       <h1>COMM 2034: Visual Media</h1>
       <h2>Professor Evia</h2><br>

     <p>Visual Media is a hands on course with the purpose of teaching
     students four major components of communication practices that can be used
     both inside and out of the classroom. We have gotten the opportunity to
     work with Adobe softwares, picture editing softwares, and different media
     platforms such as magazine spreads and websites.</p><br>

     <p>Professor Evia has been at Virginia Tech since 2004. He has been teaching classes at both the graduate level
    and the undergraduate level. Professor Evia is from Mexico and attended college in Mexico at the
    Ciencias Sociales de MÃ©rida in Yucaton Mexico. He is involved with many of the different academic programs
    here at Virginia Tech and has received many awards and recognition for all he has done for
    this university.</p><br>

    <p>I was very excited to start this class semester. Visual Media seemed very interesting when I saw that
      it was one of the required classes I needed to take. I expect to get anything higher than a B+ in this class.
      It is a very hands on class where we are constantly working with other classmates or completing projects for each module.
      I recommend anyone who needs an elective and is not a MMJ major to take this course with Professor Evia.</p><br>

      <p>GRADE EXPECTATION: A- or Higher</p>

       <h1>COMM 2084: Media and society</h1>
       <h2>Professor Mackay</h2><br>

     <p>Media and society is a course that takes a deeper look at how
     media is used in our society. In order to do this, we take a look at how issues
     come about in media today, as well as the cultural issues that influence the
     media across the globe. This course helps us realize how much our life is
     impacted by the media around us and within our lives.</p><br>

     <p>Professor Mackay received her degree from UNC Chapel Hill and then completed her masters
     at University of Alabama. Professor Mackay has been a professor at Virginia Tech since August of 2008.
     Prior to becoming a professor, she was a reporter for Roanoke Times, Asheville-Citizen Times,
     Hickory Daily Record, Chapel Hill Herald and a videographer for News Channel 11. She specializes
     in teaching communication ethics, media instituations, social media theories and practices, communication
     ethics, multimedia reporting and multimedia journalism. She has a passion for the media and how it impacts
     people in our society. Outside of her life here at Virginia Tech she takes care of her
     cats she has at home. There is nothing more important to her than her cats as she would say in the first day of class
     when going over the syllabus. Professor Mackay is all about making sure students are interacting
     with one another all of class because everything involves everyones different perspective
     in this type of course. </p><br>

     <p>This class is mandatory for my major and it is very interesting. The exams can get tricky because
     the amount of material on each one but it just takes time at home. You must make sure you are keeping up
     using the textbook. During class she goes over powerpoint slides, but it is up to you to read the
     necessary chapters outside of class. I really enjoy going to this class. I may not agree with everything that is said, but thats the beauty
     it is good to hear about things from other peoples perspective. Professor Mackay does a good job teaching this class and giving
     real life situations and events to explain certain topics. My goal is to always work hard so I can get the
     highest possible grade I can.</p>

     <p>GRADE EXPECTATION: B- or Higher</p>

       <h1>TA 2014: Intro to Theatre</h1>
       <h2>Professor Rinehart</h2><br>

     <p>Introduction to Threatre is a course that teaches students the basics about
     each different types of theatre. On top of learning about theatre, students
     also get to read numerous different plays and analyze them to better understand
     the content within play. It is fun to see all the necessary components
     needed to bring theatre production to life. We get to learn about the authors
     and the history behind each play that we read. Movies are also shown in class
     so the students can see a different perspective between the play and the play
     as a movie.</p><br>

     <p>Professor Rinehart grew up in Williamstown Massachusettes before attending UNC Chapel Hill.
     Professor Rinehart always has had a love for performing and theatre, but after graduating from
     UNC she found she also had a huge passion for teaching. Now, here at Virginia Tech,
     she can do both. She can teach other students about the shared passions she has with the numerous
     plays and performances and aspects of theatre that are taught in her classes. Professor Rinehart is a super
     fun teacher who is always putting a smile on her students faces. Her classes are never boring because she is
     always full of life and very expressive during her lectures. Professor Rinehart said that her
     favorite place on Virginia Tech's campus is the Stuido Theatre. She has said that her favorite
     thing about teaching is watching students succeed and having a drive to ask questions and want to learn.
     professor Rinehart has been around theatre since she first started performing at age four. Then, at age five, she
     was part of the cast for "The Wizard of Oz". Following this performance, there has never been a year of her life
     where she did not make theatre. A big unknown fact about professor Rinehart is that she is a very big sports fan.</p><br>

     <p>I actually signed up for this class because my friend took it and told me the teacher was very fun.
     The other reason I took it is because I used to be involved with theatre and constantly in big shows and performances.
     I needed another Area 6 class and I knew this would be a good one to chose to fulfill that credit. I highly recommend this
     course to any students. You do not have to be involved with theatre to take this class. It is nice to have a class
     where I can read plays and watch movies and live performances and learn what it takes to produce these fantastic pieces of theatre.
     This class is not a big workload. If you commit to doing all the assigned readings for
     outside of class, it makes going to class more enaging and interactive.</p><br>

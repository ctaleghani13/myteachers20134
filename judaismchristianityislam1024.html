       <h1>RLCL 1024: Judaism, Christianity, Islam</h1>
       <h2>Professor Scott</h2><br>

    <p>Judaism, Christianity, Islam is a course that takes a deeper look at the three biggest religions in our world.
      Students get to analyze the similarities and differences within these three beliefs and what some problems are when
      talking about these different religious beliefs. On top of this, we also get to look at the traditions and cultural
      history of each separate religion and the impacted they make on the people in their societies.</p><br>

     <p>Judaism, Christianity, Islam is taught by Professor Rachel Scott. Professor Scott
     has been a professor at Virginia Tech since 2011. She attended Pembroke College, University
     Oxford where she graduated with a degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. Some of her biggest
     interests include religion and law, Islam and constitutions, qur'anic interpretation, women and gender
     in Islam, Islasim in Egypt, and modern Islamic political thought. She is proud to have published
     a single book called "The Challenge of Political Islam". Professor Scott takes a lot of pride in what she
     teaches. Based on her resume, she has given a wide variety of presentations at
     Virginia Tech and the local community. She teachers eight other classes outside of
     this specific one.She has received many different awards and grants in honor of both her fantastic
     and professional accomplishments. One of the coolest less known facts of professor Scott is
     that she is TRILINGUAL. Rachel can speak English, Arabic and French, but she can also
     read in Latin. Professor Scott has also traveled around the world A LOT. She is one of the only people I
     that has been to Yemen.</p><br>

     <p>I was very interested in taking this class because all my life I have attended
     Catholic school. I always touched on the basics of some of the other teachings, but I was very interested
     to get a better idea of the teachings. These main religions have big impacts on different areas around the
     world and I was very interested in that. Another elective that I had to fulfill but I would also recommend
     this basic class for anyone who is interested in any topic related to this.</p><br>

     <p>GRADE EXPECTATION: A- or Higher </p>

       <h1>GEO 1014: World Regions</h1>
       <h2>Professor Boyer</h2><br>

     <p>World Regions is an online course here at Virginia Tech that teaches
     students about the different regions that make our our world today. The course
     is designed to be very hands on and interactive. Students should be able to
     gain a much better knowledge about the world around us and all the cultural
     implications that make our world what it is today. It is a semester long course
     where students must complete weekly quizzes and activites to achieve a certain
     amount of points.</p><br>

     <p>World Regions is taught by Proffesor John Boyer. Professor Boyer has been
     at Virginia tech teaching this course for right over a decade. He has broadcasted
     information for nearly twenty-five thousand students. Professor boyer has come up
     with new methods of teachings that many teachers will come to follow. He has created
     a hands on learning program for students to constantly be interacting with him and engaging
     in the class to better understand the material. Professor Boyer can be found in Major
     Williams Hall 121 for his office hours. Boyer is not just a teacher, he is an author,
     as well as a wine specialist. Over the course of his career, John Boyer has published
     close to twelve books that are either related to the course he teachers or his wine lab
     manages. Professor Boyer has always had a profound love for specializing in wine.
     If he is not recording videos or publishing textbooks, you can find him in his wine
     lab in the little shopping center next to Five Guys and New Image Haircuts. Professor Boyer,
     also commonly known as the "Plaid Avenger" can always be found in his exotic box car
     or behind a camera.</p><br>

     <p>I was really excited to start taking this class this semester. I am one who is very
     interested in learning about what goes on the the world around us. World Regions has
     taught me a lot of new information that will not just benefit my knowledge today
     but help me make more aware and educated decisions about places and events around the world.
     I made it my goal to accumulate enough points to reach the "A" in the class and have a good GPA boost.
     Throughout this class, I have been able to see different historical and cultural trends
     from years past and from different countries that still have impact on todays world. I would highly
     suggest that any incoming freshman or any students who still needs this area fulfilled
     to look into taking this class. It has so much to offer and always keeps you engaged inthe material.</p><br>

     <p>GRADE EXPECTATION: A</p>
